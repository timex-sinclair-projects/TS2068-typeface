# TS2068 Typeface

This is a font for the Timex Sinclair TS2068. It only includes characters available in the TS2068 character set.

Special characters are mapped to their Unicode equivalent.

NOTE: to make mapping easier the circumflex '^' has the 'up arrow' font since this is where it's located in the TS2068 character set. The 'up arrow' coexists at U+2191.
